This is the master branch style.

CONSIDER:
•creating different stylesheets for every viewport. 
•Make it a wordpress website so you can do stuff, and then upload it to github.
•create a dark/white theme
•make a "go up" button
•using variables (:root {--variable-name: rule}) usage(element {var(--variable-name)}) for styles.
