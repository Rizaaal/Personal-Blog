TO DO: 

• use external JS (done on index.html, 4 to go)
• use CSS variables
• use external fonts

consider:

• Changing the archive directory to YR -> M -> Post
• Rewrite the whole thing in english
• Make a better front logo
• Make it accessible
• show "home" when hovering on logo button

•find a way to avoid to repeat the same change on all the other HTML files of the project, if the element that has been changed is repeated in the exact same way in all the files.
